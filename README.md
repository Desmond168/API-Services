# API-Services
NetApp OnCommand API Services provides a set of APIs to manage your NetApp systems through a RESTful web service interface. This repository provides you with sample codes to address some of the storage management workflows. 

The files located in the Sample Scripts folder contain different language-specific scripts to call the APIs.

#Prerequisities
For the scripts to function, OnCommand API Services must be installed and configured in your environment. 
Additionally, depending on the sample script and the programming language, additional libraries may be needed in order to utilize the REST operations. For example, the requests library for Python, the Newtonsoft.Json.dll for C#, etc.
